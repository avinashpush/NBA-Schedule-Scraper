Hello!
As a huge NBA fan that is always looking forward to watching the games, I wanted to create a web scraper than shows me all the games for the current day. Using Tkinter as the GUI, this project
allows the user to see all the games for the current date. It shows the timings of the games and the channels that you can watch it on. This was a project to introduce me to the basics of webscraping!
